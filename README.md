⚠️ A Few Downsides
While this addon is packed with features, there are a few things to keep in mind. Currently, the script doesn’t include advanced permission settings, which might be a limitation for servers with complex permission needs. 🛡️

There are basic cooldowns in place, but no additional anti-spam features. This could allow players to bypass cooldowns if they find a way around them. 🔄

The GUI design is simple and functional but doesn’t include advanced features like custom icons or animations. This means it might not be as visually engaging as some users prefer. 🖼️

Lastly, there’s no built-in multi-language support. If your server has a diverse player base, you’ll need to manually modify the script to support other languages. 🌍
